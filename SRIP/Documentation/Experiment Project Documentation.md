# **Experiment Project Documentation**

## **Introduction**

This  document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

## **Project**

### **Domain Name :** Civil Engineering

### **Lab Name :** Basic Structural Analysis

### **Experiment Name :** Continous Beams

Continuous Beams are beams which are beams with more than 2 supports i.e. cover more than one span. They are statically indeterminate which means the parameters cannot be calculated using static equilibrium laws.
    
The aim of the experiment is to find out the shear force and bending moment diagram for a given continuous beam.

### **Purpose of the project**

The purpose of the project is to convert the **Continuous Beams** experiment simulation from **Java** to **Javascript**.

### **Process Followed to convert the experiment**

1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation
2. Understanding the experiment concept
3. Re-implement the same in javascript

### **Value Added by our Project**

1. It would be beneficial for engineering students
2. Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand the concept of perception learning.

### **Risks and Challenges**


* The equations for the beams cannot be derived from the static equilibrium equations, so the 3 moment equation has to be used to determine the reactions of the supports. **Good knowledge of mechanics is required for the derivations**.
* The project had to be implemented from scratch as no code could be extracted from the Adobe Flash files.

### **Issues :**

* The page layout has to be updated for smaller screens.
